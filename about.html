	<h2>About Ivan</h2>
	<p>Greetings! You may know me by my real name or by my alias, Ivan Petrov. In fact, you likely don't know me at all. Either way,<br>
	welcome to my crap-tastic website! Some hobbies of mine include: Messing around with technology, Playing D&D, collecting vintage<br>
	calculators/computers, reading, writing, and messing shit up for everybody.	
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2>What is the point of this website?</h2>
	<p>There isn't much of a "purpose" that this webpage serves. I guess that the main<br>
	reason for me creating it was so I could tell my buddies that I made a really awful<br>
	site with tons of unintentional "90s design" and poorly implemented CSS.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>So, what can I do now, since I'm already here?</h2>
	<p>You could browse through all of the crap at "Ramblings", or you could take a brief<br>
	look at the "Opinions" page if you want to rile yourself up with alternate. viewpoints.<br>
	I also have some stuff that you can read for free, like my really bad D&D character<br>
	sheet and some crappy 20,000 word "sci-fi" novella that I wrote quite a while ago.<br> 
	Just click on random hyperlinks until you get somewhere that's moderately interesting.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Some of the stuff on this site is offensive/stupid/uninformed/wrong/mean!!!</h2>
	<p>There's a very simple solution to this very pressing issue. Simply click on the<br>
	search bar, type in "www.tumblr.com", and complain to your heart's content!</p>
	<br>
	<h2>How could I get in touch with you to send a suggestions/comments?</h2>
	<p><td><font size="+1"><a href="contact.html">Just fill out this easy contct form.</a></font> Don't go filling my email with stupid shit.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Can I have editing privileges for this website?</h2>
	<p>Unless you...</p>
	<h3>Are Bill Gates himself</h3>
	<h3>Have the ability to turn water into wine</h3>
	<h3>Possess $10,000 that you can Pay-Pal to me</h3>
	<h3>Have stepped foot on the Moon</h3>
	<h3>Or can swallow and pass an entire box of nails</h3>			
	<p>...then no, you can not have "editing privileges"</p>
